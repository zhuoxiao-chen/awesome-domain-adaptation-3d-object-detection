This repo is a collection of AWESOME things about unsupervised domain adaptation (**UDA**), online test-time adaptation (**TTA**), and domain generalization (**DG**) for 3D object detection, including papers, code, etc. Feel free to star and fork. This repo mainly focuses on **AI/CV/ML** conferences and journals.
